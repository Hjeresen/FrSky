# DLG-F3K-script
Original script comes from RC-Settings and is ment for the Taranis radio. It adds a screen with a graph that can be used for DLG training.

Original script is from J.W.G.  (filago on RCGroups) (rev 2.1   06/15/2015).
I downloaded this from:
http://rcsettings.com/index.php/viewdownload/13-lua-scripts/217-dlg-flight-graph-for-opentx-2-0-x

I have had contact with him and he is fine if with it if I try tho get the script a bit further

New RC-settings page is here:
http://rcsettings.com/index.php/viewdownload/13-lua-scripts/278-dlg-flight-graph-for-opentx-2-2

I will make some changes to this to improve it. If the owner does not like this, please contact me so I will get this all down!
